# 📖 Sandbox Goal

The goal of this sandbox is to test the usage of
[Click](https://pypi.org/project/click/). Click is a Python package for creating
beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as
necessary. It’s the “Command Line Interface Creation Kit”. It’s highly
configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.

It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun while
also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement an intended
CLI API.

I've created this sandbox to explore how Click works and see how I could
implement it in some applications I'm developing.
